# Covid19-DietPreference
The repo contains the code and data for the research project that I conducted in Dartmouth QSS54: Intermediate Quantitative Data Analysis for Sociologists. My research aims to determine the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on vegetarian diet preference within the United States. In this study, I argue that in the United States, the local COVID-19 pandemic increases people’s preference for the vegetarian diet by pushing people to be healthier or more health-conscious.

I present the following hypothesis:
(1) State-level COVID-19 rate are positively associated with people’s preference for the vegetarian diet , controlling for the unemployment rate.
(2) State-level unemployment rate will suppress the positive association between local COVID-19 rate and people’s preference for vegetarian diet.
